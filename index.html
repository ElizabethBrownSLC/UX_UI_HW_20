          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been encouraged to social distance and avoid 
            crowded areas.  One problem that we suspect will arise is that people will need to start looking for vacation and travel 
            ideas outside of major cities.  Great travel attractions and destinations exist outside of major cities and tourist 
            destinations, but it is often difficult for travelers to get information on  ‘off the beaten path’ vacation spots. 
            Travelers would benefit from a travel app where lesser-known attractions and destinations are featured and 
            available to those looking to travel somewhere with no crowds. This app would allow users to browse new places by 
            location, interests or their budget.

          <p>
            All time visitation records are being broken at national parks. This is creating a need to encourage people to travel to 
            lesser-visited destinations, guided experiences and off-season travel.

                    <p>
                        One of the exercises we conducted to understand our user more was to interview a variety of people. These interviews 
                        provided us with data that we used to create an affinity diagram. We were able to see how users planned their vacations 
                        and activities and what technologies and features the user enjoyed in other applications.

                        After analyzing all the data we gathered from our research we were introduced to Sarah Smith. Sarah was our ideal 
                        user, our decision making from here on out would be centered on what would meet Sarah's wants and needs. Our main 
                        goal was to please Sarah and provide her with a tool that she would enjoy.

                    <p>
                        We used the I Like... I Wish... What If... ideation method. Brainstorming like this helped us look at what our user 
wanted in the present, the near future, and the distant future. We then organized those ideas into a feature 
prioritization matrix in order to give Sarah features that would have the most impact.

                <h1>Getting Remotely Into the Hands of Testers and Making Iterations</h1>
                <p>
                    We completed the prototyping and set up exercises to test the features. During testing we discovered the testers 
needed a more linear path to complete the task of planning a vacation. The first screen was a dashboard that allowed 
the user to explore the app but created a distraction from the task. We changed the app to place the user within the 
planning vacation step right after on boarding and then broke that screen into two. The first screen provided a fun 
interaction of choosing a travel persona and then they could set custom details about the vacation they wanted to take. 
This helped solve some confusion if the user had strayed away from the main task.</p>

                    <h1>Creating User Focused Features</h1>
                    <p>After the research, the ideation, and the prototyping we knew what features would make Remotely an enjoyable
                        experience for Sarah. We knew Remotely had to offer a way for users to customize their trips. Once the user set their
                        customization they could then select from featured destinations or plan their own trip. Users would be able to see maps,
                        pictures, and ratings of destinations and activities. Finally they could invite and share their itineraries..</p>
